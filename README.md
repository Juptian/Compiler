Uranium is a compiler that I decided to make from scratch, it is targetted at the CLR and will hopefully output IL code later. Currently, Uranium isn't finished

Finally, please be patient as I try to fix it. If it's not fixed quickly, you can always contribute to the repo by making a PR for it

<h2 align="center"> Not understand a part of the code? </h2>
Feel free to open an issue asking about it, asking for specifications or asking me to write a `README` about it, I'll be more than happy to respond!

<h2 align="center"> Using & Installing </h2>

To use the compiler, please make sure you have .NET 5 installed, once you've done that, do the following steps:
* Add text to the ` test.urnm ` file located in the central folder
* Either run the ` run.bat ` file I have in that same directory, or run it via command line with ` dotnet run test.txt `

<h3 align="center"> Additional arguments: </h3>
The current command line arguments accepted are:

```
--#showtree
```
This will show the syntax tree that is produced.

<h3 align="center"> How to use additional arguments: </h3>
To use additional arguments, simply type 

```
dotnet run test.txt
``` 
 
then add each argument, separated by a space, so for example:

``` 
dotnet run test.txt --#showtree 
```
